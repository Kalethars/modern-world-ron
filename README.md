# Modern World - Rise of Nations conquest MOD
Created by Kalethars

## Q & A
1. **How to use it?**  
   Download and extract it under game path.

2. **What should I notice when playing?**  
   Does not support alliance with CPU nations. May cause expected bugs.

3. **Will you update it often?**  
   I made this MOD long time ago, and I will probably not update it very often. But I think its playability is much better than original "Conquer the World". If you have advices or find any bugs, please let me know, I will fix it as soon as I can.
