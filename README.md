# Modern World - Conquest MOD for *Rise of Nations Extended Edition*
Created by *Kalethars*

## Q & A
1. **How to use it?**<br>
   Download and extract it to game path(you can see ".\conquest" folder, just merge them). Run the game and you can find "Modern World" under conquest mode. Have fun!

2. **What should I notice when playing?**<br>
   Does not support alliance with CPU nations. May cause expected bugs if you do so. Besides, this mod may only support extended edition, you can get the game on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/287450/Rise_of_Nations_Extended_Edition/">Steam</a>.
   
3. **Is It fun?**<br>
   It depends. I think its playability is much better than original "Conquer the World". I didn't design special scenarios but add game modes for randomly generated maps. I also made several original game modes more difficult and fixed bugs in original scripts(such as airlift).

4. **Will you update it often?**<br>
   I made this MOD long time ago, and I will probably not update it very often. If you have advices or find any bugs, please let me know, I will fix it as soon as I can.
